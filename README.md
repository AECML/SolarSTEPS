# SolarSTEPS

SolarSTEPS is a probabilistic surface solar radiation (SSR) nowcasting model based on PySTEPS (https://github.com/pySTEPS/pysteps). 
This repository contains the code for using SolarSTEPS to make predictions and the code used to compute the metrics in our paper (a preprint is available at '').

We recommend to download the model and run in a Python 3.9 environment, 3.10 should work too.

To make the proababilistic forecast reproducible, the ensemble members are assigned with a seed as shown in Forecast.ipynb.
